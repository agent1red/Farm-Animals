# Portfolio Project - Kevin Hudson

This repo is part of my growing portfolio of projects as I continue learning the ins and outs of Object Oriented Programming. 

## Farm Animals Replica In JavaScript

This project utilizes the Phaser.js library (framework) to replicate a mobile version of Farm Animals 2D game for toddlers. 
Rather than building an HTML5 JavaScript game from scratch, Phaser.js framework helps with asset loading, canvas rendering, audio
inputs, physics and more. 

### Prerequisites

Just about any web browser will support this small game example.
